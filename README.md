# NHLStenden_Year1_Assignments
Here I'll be saving my weekly assignments during my first year in NHL Stenden, so I can better see my progress over time.

# Highlights
These are my first lines of proper code, therefore they aren't perfect but allowed me to expand my knowledge on the matter like:
- Basics of HTML, CSS and PHP
- How to connect all languages in a way to create a website
- Importance of each laguage for different functionalities
- Useful tags/functions/methods offered by each laguage

# Overview
Since this is a small "storage unit" of my assignments to view my progress over time, the code I present here won't be perfect on the slighest but I want to leave it uncorrected so I can see my progress, later on I would like to add a "correction version" of my code made right now that my knowledge of the required languages have extended, but such will depend of the time I have during my current assignments, studies and work.

# Authors
This is solely made by me, Jessica Camacho, a student of NHL Stenden.

# Usage
Multiple kinds of assignments will be stored in this repository, to fill in my first year in NHL Stenden, therefore there is not really a specific use for any of them, besides the purpose to learn from past mistakes.

# Installation
There is not really a specific installation that needs to be made to run most of the codes I'm going to leave here, but since I'll be using quite a lot of PHP, and such language is a server-side language, if anyone wishes to run it locally there will be needed an "all-in-one" stack installs Apache (web server), MySQL (database), and PHP like:
1. Download and instal Local Server Packages:
   For example, XAMPP (cross-platform), WAMP (Windows), or MAMP (macOS).
2. Start the Server:
   Open the control panel of the application you installed and click Start next to the Apache module.
3. Place Your Files:
   Move your .php files into the server's root directory (typically C:\xampp\htdocs for XAMPP or /Applications/MAMP/htdocs for MAMP).
4. View in Browser:
   Open your web browser and go to http://localhost/your-file.php
